## Project Description 

## User Story ##
As a manager of an organization, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic information so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

## Features ##
This application has the following features:
* This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates a HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 
* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
* WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
 THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
* WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
* WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
* WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
* WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
* WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
* WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
* WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
